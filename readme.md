This MTG mod adds new types of stone with cobbled and brick forms, along with biomes for them to spawn in.

Limestone
---------

You can find this soft, pale sedimentary rock adorning humid cliffs. The rock is easy to break and can be carved into elongated white bricks for building purposes. Limestone can also be shaped into pillars for use in temples or other posh buildings.

Basalt
------

A hard, dark grey igneous rock that can be found in columns around hot, dry coasts. It is tougher than the other types of stone and can be carved into large black bricks. It can also be shaped into blocks for extra variation.

Slate
-----

A soft, bluish metamorphic rock found underground. It is particularly soft, but has a particularly interesting texture, and can be carved into slate tiles.
