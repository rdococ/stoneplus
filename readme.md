This MTG mod adds new types of stone with cobbled and brick forms, along with biomes for them to spawn in.

Limestone
---------

A soft, light grey sedimentary rock found adorning coastal cliffs. The rock is easy to break and can be carved into elongated white bricks for building purposes. Limestone can also be shaped into pillars for use in temples or other posh buildings.

Basalt
------

A hard, dark grey igneous rock that naturally generates in columns around hot, dry coasts. It is tougher than the other types of stone and can be carved into large black bricks.

Slate
-----

A soft, bluish metamorphic rock found underground. It is particularly soft, but has a very interesting texture and it can be carved into slate tiles perfect for roofing homes.
